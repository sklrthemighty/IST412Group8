## Explanation
> The app's main features will involve buying tickets, scheduling activities receiving updates on park status and ordering food options that cater to different guest preferences while also offering useful insights, for park administrators. In terms of operations, the app should connect with the park systems, for ticketing, point of sale transactions, and managing attractions. Moreover, it should offer analytic tools to help park administrators allocate resources efficiently and enhance the overall effectiveness of the park experience.  

USE CASE 1: Buy tickets, food, and/or drink

Our implemented use case allows users to purchase park tickets and concessions through the WallyLand Vacation Planner application. Users can select admission tickets, food items, and drinks from available options, add them to a cart, and complete the purchase using their preferred payment method. The application provides real-time inventory updates and order confirmation.
